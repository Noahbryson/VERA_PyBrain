# VERA_PyBrain
Library for manipulating VERA (Versatile Electrode Localization Framework) output files for 2D and 3D brain reconstruction and data visualization.

Please note this is under development and currently does not do much other than (rather nicely) load vera files to emulate the MATLAB structure.
